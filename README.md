# Gender Detection

This is a report developed by me and [Alessio Carachino](https://github.com/CarachinoAlessio) for [Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01URTOV&p_a_acc=2022&p_header=S&p_lang=&multi=N) course.

We have tested some techniques studied during the lectures, all of them developed from scratch:
* Preprocessing:
  * Z-score Normalization
  * Gaussianized Features
  * PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  * LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
* Classification Models:
  * Multivariate Gaussian Classifiers
  * Logistic Regression
  * Support-vector Machine
  * Gaussian Mixure Models
